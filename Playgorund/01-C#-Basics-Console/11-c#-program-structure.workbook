# 01 C# Program Structure

A C# program consists of the following parts:

* 

* 

* A Main method

* Statements and Expressions

* Comments

## Namespaces

C# scripting doesnâ€™t support declaring namespaces - in script code like Workbooks namespaces are not allowed.

```csharp
//namespace Utilities
{
    // Declarations and Definitions for Classes / Structs / Enums
}
```

## Classes

```csharp
public class Person
{

}
```

In C# scripting user can declare the same construct (variable, class, function and so forth) over and over again.

```csharp
public partial class City
{
    public string Name;
}
```

```csharp
public partial class City
{
    public int Zip;
}
```

The last declaration shadows any earlier declaration.

```csharp
City zagreb = new City()
{
    // Name = "Zagreb", // error!
    Zip = 10000    
}
```
